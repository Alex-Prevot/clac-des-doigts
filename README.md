# **Introduction**

*Welcome to the Chicken Creator API project! The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly API that allows you to create, delete, and modify chicken data. We've built this API with the latest technologies, including Express.js for our backend, Prisma PostgreSQL for our database, and React for our front-end. The entire project is dockerized for ease of deployment and maintenance.*

*This README.md will provide an overview of the project, including how to set it up and how to use the API. Let's dive in and start creating some chickens!* :smiley:
